`mamba` is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++.

- parallel downloading of repository data and package files using multi-threading
- libsolv for much faster dependency solving, a state of the art library used in the RPM package manager of Red Hat, Fedora and OpenSUSE
- core parts of `mamba` are implemented in C++ for maximum efficiency

At the same time, `mamba` utilizes the same command line parser, package installation and deinstallation code and transaction verification routines as `conda` to stay as compatible as possible.

`mamba` is part of the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) ecosystem, which also consists of `quetz`, an open source `conda` package server.

You can read our [announcement blog post](https://medium.com/@QuantStack/open-software-packaging-for-science-61cecee7fc23).

## micromamba

`micromamba` is the statically linked version of `mamba`.

It can be installed as a standalone executable without any dependencies, making it a perfect fit for CI/CD pipelines and containerized environments.

See the [documentation on `micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) for details.

## `mamba` v.s. `micromamba`

`mamba` has to be preferred when:

- `libmambapy` or `libmamba` is used by other software in the same environment.
- Scenarios where regular updates to libraries are required (especially for security).
- Environments are focused on reducing disk space usage for dependencies.

`micromamba` has to be preferred when:

- Relying a single self-contained executable is required.
- A miniforge distribution is not present.
- Usage requires minimal runtime.

## Installation

Please refer to the [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)
and [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) installation guide in the documentation.

## Additional features in Mamba and Micromamba

`mamba` and `micromamba` come with features on top of stock `conda`.

### `repoquery`

To efficiently query repositories and query package dependencies you can use `mamba repoquery` or `micromamba repoquery`.

See the [repoquery documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html#repoquery) for details.

### Installing lock files

`micromamba` can be used to install lock files generated by [conda-lock](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/) without having to install `conda-lock`.

Simply invoke `micromamba create` with the `-f` option, providing an environment lockfile whose name ends with
`-lock.yml` or `-lock.yaml`; for instance:

```bash
micromamba create -n my-env -f conda-lock.yml
```

### setup-micromamba (setup-miniconda replacement)

[setup-micromamba](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-micromamba) is a replacement for [setup-miniconda](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda) that uses `micromamba`.

It can significantly reduce your CI setup time by:

- Using `micromamba`, which takes around 1 s to install.
- Caching package downloads.
- Caching entire `conda` environments.

## Differences with `conda`

While `mamba` and `micromamba` are generally a drop-in replacement for `conda` there are some differences:

- `mamba` and `micromamba` do no support revisions (for discussions, see <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/issues/803>)
- `mamba` and `micromamba` normalize `MatchSpec` strings to the simplest form, whereas `conda` use a more verbose form
  This can lead to slight differences in the output of `conda env export` and `mamba env export`.

## Development installation

Please refer to the instructions given by the [official documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_zone/dev_environment.html).

## Support us

Only `mamba` and `micromamba` 2.0 and later are supported and are actively developed.

The `1.x` branch is only maintained for addressing security issues such as CVEs.
