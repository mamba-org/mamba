`mamba` is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++.

- parallel downloading of repository data and package files using multi-threading
- libsolv for much faster dependency solving, a state of the art library used in the RPM package manager of Red Hat, Fedora and OpenSUSE
- core parts of `mamba` are implemented in C++ for maximum efficiency

At the same time, `mamba` utilizes the same command line parser, package installation and deinstallation code and transaction verification routines as `conda` to stay as compatible as possible.

Mamba is part of a bigger ecosystem to make scientific packaging more sustainable. You can read our [announcement blog post](https://medium.com/@QuantStack/open-software-packaging-for-science-61cecee7fc23).
The ecosystem also consists of `quetz`, an open source `conda` package server and `boa`, a fast `conda` package builder.

## Installation

Please refer to the [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) and [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) installation guide in the documentation.

## Additional features in Mamba and Micromamba

`mamba` and `micromamba` come with features on top of stock `conda`.

### `repoquery`

To efficiently query repositories and query package dependencies you can use `mamba repoquery` or `micromamba repoquery`.
See the [repoquery documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html#repoquery) for details.

### Installing lock files

`micromamba` can be used to install lock files generated by [conda-lock](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/) without having to install `conda-lock`. Simply invoke e.g. `micromamba create -n my-env -f conda-lock.yml` with an environment lockfile named `*-lock.yml` or `*-lock.yaml`.

### setup-micromamba (setup-miniconda replacement)

[setup-micromamba](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-micromamba) is a replacement for [setup-miniconda](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda) that uses `micromamba`.
It can significantly reduce your CI setup time by:

- Using `micromamba`, which takes around 1 s to install.
- Caching package downloads.
- Caching entire `conda` environments.

## micromamba

`micromamba` is a small, pure-C++ reimplementation of `mamba`/`conda`. It strives to be a full replacement for `mamba` and `conda`. As such, it doesn't use any `conda` code (in fact it doesn't require Python at all).

See the [documentation on `micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) for details.

## Development installation

Please refer to the instructions given by the [official documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_zone/dev_environment.html).
