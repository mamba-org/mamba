Welcome to Mamba's documentation!
=================================

Mamba is a fast, robust, and cross-platform package manager.

It runs on Windows, OS X and Linux (ARM64 and PPC64LE included) and is fully compatible with ``conda`` packages and supports most of conda's commands.

Mamba is a framework with several components:

- ``libmamba``: a C++ library of the domain, exposing low-level and high-level APIs
- ``mamba``: a ELF as a *drop-in* replacement for ``conda``, built on top of ``libmamba``
- ``micromamba``: the statically linked version of ``mamba``
- ``libmambapy``: python bindings of ``libmamba``

.. note::
   In this documentation, ``Mamba`` will refer to all flavors while flavor-specific details will mention ``mamba``, ``micromamba`` or ``libmamba``.

.. note::
    :ref:`micromamba<micromamba>` is especially well fitted for the CI use-case but not limited to that!

You can try Mamba now by visiting the installation for
:ref:`mamba<mamba-install>` or :ref:`micromamba<umamba-install>`
