0.15.0 (July 9, 2021)
=====================

Big changes:
- improve solutions by inspecting dependency versions as well (libsolv PR:
  https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/pull/457) @wolfv
- properly implement strict channel priority (libsolv PR:
  https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/pull/459) @adriendelsalle
	+ Note that this changes the meaning of strict and flexible priority as the
	  previous implementation did not follow conda's semantics. Mamba now has
	  three modes, just like conda: strict, flexible and disabled. Strict will
	  completely disregard any packages from lower-priority channels if a
	  package of the same name exists in a higher priority channel. Flexible
	  will use packages from lower-priority channels if necessary to fulfill
	  dependencies or explicitly requested (e.g. by version number). Disabled
	  will use the highest version number, irregardless of the channel order.
- allow subdir selection as part of the channel: users can now specify an
  explicit list of subdirs, for example:

      `-c mychannel[linux-static64, linux-64, noarch]`

  to pull in repodata and packages from these three subdirs.
