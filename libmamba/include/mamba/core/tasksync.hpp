    /** Synchronize tasks execution in multiple threads with this object's lifetime.

        A synchronized callable will never execute outside the lifetime of this object.
        To achieve this, the callable must be wrapped into a callable with the same
        features that will guarantee that
          - if this object have been destroyed and then the synchronized callable is invoked,
            the callable will not execute it's code;
          - if this object is being joined and/or destroyed, it will block until any already started
            tasks are ended;

        WARNING: When used as a member of a type to synchronized tasks of the `this` instance, it is
        best to set the TaskSynchronizer as the last member so that it is the first one to be
       destroyed; alternatively, `.join_tasks()` can be called manually in the destructor too.

        Example:

            class MonSystem
            {
            public:

                // Whatever "scheduler" or "other_sys" is....
                MonSystem(Scheduler scheduler, OtherSystem other_sys) : scheduler(sccheduler)
                {
                    // This callback will do nothing if this object is destroyed.
                    other_sys.on_something(synchronized.synchronized([this]{ ok(); }));
                }

                void ok();

                void launch_work()
                {
                    // This task will do nothing if this object is destroyed.
                    scheduler.push(task_sync.synchronized([this]{
                        ...
                    }));
                }

            private:

                Scheduler scheduler;
                BigData data;

                task_synchronizer task_sync; // When this object is destroyed, join tasks.
            };

            The wrapper guarantees that if the resulting callable is invoked:
                - if the joining function of this synchronizer have been called, skip execution;
                - if the joining function of this synchronizer is called while the callback is
           invoked, it will block until the end of the body of the original callable;
                - if no joining function have been called yet, notify the synchronizer that the
                    execution begins, then execute the body;

            @param work Any callable object with no arguments. The return value will be ignored.
            @return A wrapped version of the provided callable object, adding checks
                preventing execution of the original callable body if any joining function
